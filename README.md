# Optimization of NBA teams

This was a project that I did in the [Optimization Algorithms](https://mtt.etf.bg.ac.rs/ms/osnovni.optimizacioni.algoritmi.htm) class during my master studies in winter of 2022.

The goal was to use the NSGA II (non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm) on a dataset containing NBA players overall (extracted from NBA 2k22) and salaries to create the best possible teams with the lowest salaries possible. 
From an engineering point of view, this is a multiple optimization problem, so the output of the analysis is the Pareto front.

The detailed description of the process is, for now,  available in Serbian as a .pdf document (in the form of an exam).
